## Introduction

### Scenario
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

### Goal
The goal of this project, as a data engineer, is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. It is also expected to test the database and ETL pipeline by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare the results with their expected results.

## Project Description
* Build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift based on the knowledge of data warehouses and AWS.

* Load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Dataset
Two sets of data are presented: the **Song Dataset** and the **Log Dataset**. These datasets reside in S3, and here are the S3 links for each:

* Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
* Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
* Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, **TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json**, looks like.

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, **2018-11-12-events.json**, looks like.

## Database and the Star Schema Design
Using the song and log datasets, a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis was created based on the following entity-relationship (ER) diagram:
![ER Diagram](/ERD.png)

This includes the following tables:
### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
    * *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*
### Dimension Tables
1. **users** - users in the app
    * *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
2. **songs** - songs in music database
    * *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
3. **artists** - artists in music database
    * *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
4. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
    * *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*


## Files in this Project
This project workspace includes four files:

1. `create_tables.py` is where the fact and dimension tables are created for the star schema in Redshift.

2. `etl.py` is will load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into the analytics tables on Redshift.

5. `sql_queries.py` is where the SQL statements are defined, which will be imported into the two other files above.

6. `README.md` provide discussion on your process and decisions for this ETL pipeline.

## Project Instructions

### Create Table Schema

1. Design schemas for the fact and dimension tables (described as above).
2. Write a SQL `CREATE` statement for each of these tables in `sql_queries.py`.
3. Complete the logic in `create_tables.py` to connect to the database and create these tables.
4. Write SQL `DROP` statements to drop tables in the beginning of `create_tables.py` if the tables already exist. This way, one can run `create_tables.py` whenever he/she wants to reset the database and test the ETL pipeline.
5. Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
6. Add redshift database and IAM role info to `dwh.cfg`.
7. Test by running `create_tables.py` and checking the table schemas in the redshift database. Use Query Editor in the AWS Redshift console for this.

### Build ETL Pipeline

1. Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Test by running `etl.py` after running `create_tables.py` and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare the results with the expected results.
4. Delete the redshift cluster when finished.

### Notes

1. File dwh.cfg does not contain HOST and IAM Role for security reasons.
